    SVoice is a revolutionary new IntelliJ plugin that helps you improve your pronunciation skills. With its cutting-edge technology, this plugin will play audio of the text you've selected, allowing you to hear exactly how a word or sentence should be pronounced.
    To use this plugin, all you need to do is select the text you want to hear, and then click "The Speaker" on the menu bar. From there, simply click "Speak Selected Text" and the audio will start playing.
